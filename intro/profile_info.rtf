Short Bio\
Life began in Louisiana, and I grew up in a town called Zanesville, Ohio. After college at Duke I spent some time in Shanghai, China, (which was incredible) and learned some Mandarin. At this point I realized my love for all things language, and began to dabble with programming in my spare time, first writing a Ruby script that answered whether I should pay for wash & fold service of do laundry myself. Fast forward 3 years of time spent on Wall Street and I was ready to pursue something that would empower me to pursue my personal interests full-time. I found the Flatiron School and was graciously accepted - now to make the most of every moment here. Since I love teaching & getting to know people, eventually I'd love to start a programming school of my own in a place like, say, Myanmar.\
