Short Bio
Someday in 1995, I dialed into the internet for the first time. Though I was only 12, I instantly knew that the web was my future. Immediately, I started teaching myself to program and have not stopped since. My career began at 16 when I worked for an NYC startup, cityfeet.com. At 20, I was the CTO of a hedgefund. Then I started a site called designerpages.com. I also organize one of the largest Rails meetups in the world, NYC on Rails.
